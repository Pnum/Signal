Signal is a coherent noise generator for use with the DM language. Visit http://www.byond.com for more information.

What is coherent noise?
-----------------------
From http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/coherentnoise/index.html, coherent noise is a type of smooth pseudorandom noise
generated by a function with the following properties:
* Passing in the same input value will always return the same output value.
* A small change in the input value will produce a small change in the output value.
* A large change in the input value will produce a pseudorandom change in the output value.

Why is coherent noise useful?
-----------------------------
Coherent noise has a variety of applications. It is typically used for generating textures and terrain for use in
games. It can be used in place of any pseudorandomrandom process to create a more "natural" sequence of
pseudorandom numbers.
